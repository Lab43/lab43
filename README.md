# Lab 43


## To Do:
* remove unneeded stuff from modernizr
* look into best practices for loading Typekit
* The smooth scrolling code, in plugins.js, is a little hacked together. I had to change it so that empty anchor links ("#") would scroll to the top of the page. I should clean this up, package it as a jQuery plugin, and publish it to GitHub.
